<h2>tldr</h2>
<p>Disaster flick crossed with rom com starring two midwestern teens. Austin and Robby, our two midwestern teens, undiscouraged by surplus of mutant insect-induced carnage.</p>
<h2>indicative quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We sat there sitting and smoking. Everything was shitty and confusing. Robby felt terrible. [45]</p>
<p>It’s good to have a cigarette with your best friend [96]</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>why bother?</h2>
<p>Fun and funny and sweet. Galloping story. Characters you will like. The book is really YA in label only, so don't be scared off by that.</p>
<h2>miscellanea</h2>
<p>sexuality</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Queer is just a word. Like orange. I know who you are. There’s no one word for that. [120]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>history</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The book would be as big as the universe, and it would take multiple countless lifetimes to read. History necessarily had to be an abbreviation. [67]</p>
<p>You could never get everything in a book. Good book are always about everything. [76]</p>
