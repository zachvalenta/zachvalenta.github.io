<h3>longer version</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I graduated university w/ a <strong>degree in English</strong>. My thesis advisor had a research focus in China and I became interested in the country, so <strong>after graduation I moved to China</strong> and spent a couple years learning the language. </p></li>
<li><p>After that I <strong>worked for Johns Hopkins University</strong> in a Chinese-speaking role for 3 years. </p></li>
<li><p>During this time I also operated a <strong>media startup</strong> covering consumer-facing Chinese tech businesses with a good friend. We parlayed that business into <strong>strategy consulting for tech startups</strong>, specifically in the mobile messaging space (this was in 2014-2015). </p></li>
<li><p>In 2016 I attended a software bootcamp (Zipcode Wilmington) and started a <strong>software engineering role at JP Morgan</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>I worked <strong>at JP for 2+ years</strong> across two teams. I did mostly backend and ops, the former in PHP, Python, and Java and the latter re: load balancers, Cloud Foundry, and Splunk. </p></li>
<li><p>In March 2019 I went on <strong>sabbatical in London</strong>, where I wrote a bunch of code and got into chess. </p></li>
<li><p>I started contracting for <strong>Capital One in June 2019</strong>, where my team is rebuilding a system to do risk ratings for commercial loans; my role is writing Dockerized Flask microservices.</p></li>
