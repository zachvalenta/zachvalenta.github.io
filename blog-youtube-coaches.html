<h2>YouTube coaches for the pros</h2>
<hr/>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LeeWylie1/videos">Lee Wylie</a> has a long-standing boxing Youtube channel.</p>
<p>Apparently the now-unified welterweight champion [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Taylor_(boxer)">Josh Taylor</a>] noticed the channel and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ4K6uqXggQ">brought Wylie in ahead of his unification fight</a> to scout his opponent [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ram%C3%ADrez_(boxer)">Jose Ramirez</a>].</p>
<p>Wylie breaks down the fight <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4TVVA3gjkI">here</a>; his guy won.</p>
<p>There seem to be two competing laws when it comes to human capital and regulation/bureaucratization/accreditation:</p>
<ul>
<li>anything not incentivized to resist will succumb to regulation e.g. cost disease of higher ed, licensing for barbers</li>
<li>anything open to private scholarship will resist regulation e.g. software bootcamps, online boxing film study</li>
</ul>
<p>And they apply at the same time. Barber licensing, for example: my brother's friend taught himself how to cut hair from Youtube (private scholarship) and now makes money barbering, but must do so in the informal economy (regulation).</p>
