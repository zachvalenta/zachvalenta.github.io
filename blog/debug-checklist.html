<h2>Have a debug checklist</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>make your own checklist</h3>
<p>Atul Gawade's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000">The Checklist Manifesto</a> teaches us: </p>
<ul>
<li>checklists are incredibly useful</li>
<li>the hardest part of a checklist is actually sticking to the checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step to addressing both of those points is to actually have a checklist. For whatever reason, I've never seen anyone debug according to an explicit checklist, but I think it might be worthwhile. Here's my attempt at making one for myself.</p>
<h3>my checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li>read the error message, read the code</li>
<li>if stuck, check out Duck Duck Go and Stack Overflow</li>
<li>if still stuck, get back to the previous working state by:
<ul>
<li>rebuilding the code</li>
<li>checking out the develop branch or a previous working commit</li>
<li>recloning the repo</li>
</ul></li>
<li>some things to double check:
<ul>
<li>are there any environment variables that need to be set? any env var incorrectly set?</li>
<li>are the logs masking anything?</li>
<li>anything left in environment from a previous branch (db migration, dependencies)?</li>
<li>anything wonky w/ dependencies or their versions?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If things get really dire, I take a walk and think about something else and then, when I'm back at my desk, ask myself <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/01/learning-skills-you-can-practice/">what do I <em>actually</em> know?</a></p>
<h3>other advice</h3>
<p>Another benefit of having a checklist is, if you need to enroll the help of a coworker or collaborator, you've got a list of things you've tried and the results of those tries. Plus, you've proof that you put effort and consideration into solving the problem on your own and therefore respect their time.</p>
<p>p.s. Julia Evans has a bunch of <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/06/23/a-few-debugging-resources/">other debugging advice</a> that you should check out.</p>
