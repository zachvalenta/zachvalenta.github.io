<h2>DX (dev experience) should be a thing</h2>
<hr/>
<p><strong>What is DX?</strong></p>
<p>'DX' means 'dev experience'.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you coining a neologism?</strong></p>
<p>Developers lack a succinct and memorable way to characterize a software library's ease of use.</p>
<p><strong>Is this like UX (user experience)?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I care about DX?</strong></p>
<p>For the same reasons you care about UX. </p>
<p>If your project is unpleasant to use, other developers won't use it (unless they have to for work; congratulations?).</p>
<p><strong>How to have good DX?</strong></p>
<p>Use 'immediate files'.</p>
<p><strong>What are immediate files?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re browsing a directory full of source code, it’s useful to see the documentation or build script that “kicks off” the entire project. This is why <a href="https://the.exa.website">exa</a> calls them <a href="https://the.exa.website/features/colours">immediate files</a> — they’re meant to be the first file you read or run. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What are some examples of immediate files?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa/blob/4c73a3353025f09410301af5d7e8c8b738db92a5/src/info/filetype.rs#L22">Examples include</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>README.md</code></li>
<li><code>Makefile</code></li>
<li>language-specific files like <code>build.gradle</code> or <code>Rakefile</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What's the cost of using immediate files?</strong></p>
<p>They have to be maintained to avoid rot.</p>
<p><strong>Is it hard to maintain immediate files?</strong></p>
<p>No. PRs to an immediate file tend to be one line, one file affairs. <a href="https://codeascraft.com/2018/10/10/etsys-experiment-with-immutable-documentation">More involved systems</a> don't seem necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I go to learn more about documentation?</strong></p>
<p>Stripe publishes a magazine on engineering and they have a whole issue on documentation <a href="https://increment.com/documentation/">here</a>.</p>
<p>There's a good Hacker News thread on technical documentation <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20909783">here</a>.</p>
