<h2>Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman</h2>
<h3>overview</h3>
<p>This book is popular among the software developer crowd (think the UX version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898">Lean Startup</a>).</p>
<p>The premise of this book is that many things are designed poorly <em>for the end-user</em>. </p>
<p>This bit, '<em>for the end-user</em>', is important. Why? </p>
<p>Many of the things designed poorly for the end-user are also </p>
<ul>
<li>finely wrought</li>
<li>expensive</li>
<li>fashionable</li>
</ul>
<p>These good qualities mask an important bad quality: they suck to use.</p>
<p>Norman's antidote: 'human-centered design' (i.e. do not make your product suck to use). </p>
<h3>things I don't like about the book</h3>
<p>'Design of Everyday Things' is not well written and unenjoyable to read. It falls into the category of a Blinkist book, that is, a book with 15 minutes of ideas spread across 200 pages of bad writing.</p>
<p>Norman also goes about inventing unhelpful vocabulary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I call the signalling component of affordances <em>signifiers</em>" [13] </p>
<p>"I call the combined information available to us the system image" [31]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>good ideas gone ubiquitous</h3>
<p>Norman offers some rules of thumb for designers:</p>
<ul>
<li>controls should be clearly mapped (by proximity) to what they control [136]</li>
<li>give feedback to the user [156]</li>
<li>avoid adding too many features (aka 'featuritis') [261]</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules seem pretty well understood, even by non-UX people. Should you even bother reading the book?</p>
<p>If 'Design of Everyday Things' is less useful to read in 2018 because all its ideas are already gospel.</p>
<p>Then again, given how often we make UX mistakes, and how little devlopers seem to care about <a href="../blog/dx.html">providing a good experience to other developers</a>, Norman still merits a look (esp. if you're the person directly in charge of making sure the product doesn't suck to use).</p>
<p>The experience of reading this book is kinda like reading Dale Carnegie's 'How to Win Friends and Influence People'; their messages can wear thin but repeating this stuff is helpful.</p>
