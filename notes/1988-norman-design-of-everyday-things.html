<h2>Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>overview</h3>
<p>This book is popular among the software developer crowd (think the UX version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898">Lean Startup</a>).</p>
<p>The premise of this book is that many things are designed poorly <em>for the end-user</em>. </p>
<p>This bit, '<em>for the end-user</em>', is important. Why? </p>
<p>Many of the things designed poorly for the end-user are also:</p>
<ul>
<li>finely wrought</li>
<li>expensive</li>
<li>fashionable</li>
</ul>
<p>These good qualities (fine-wrought, expensive) mask an important bad quality: they actually suck to use for the people who will actually be using them.</p>
<p>Norman's antidote to this is 'human-centered design', which more or less amounts to 'do not make your product suck to use'. </p>
<h3>things I don't like about the book</h3>
<p>'Design of Everyday Things' is not well written and is unenjoyable to read. It falls into the category of a <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/">Blinkist</a> book, that is, a book with 15 minutes of ideas spread across 200 pages of bad writing.</p>
<p>Norman unhelpfully invents his own vocabulary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I call the signalling component of affordances <em>signifiers</em>" [13] </p>
<p>"I call the combined information available to us the <em>system image</em>" [31]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>good ideas gone ubiquitous</h3>
<p>Norman offers some rules of thumb for designers:</p>
<ul>
<li>controls should be proximate to what they control [136]</li>
<li>give feedback to the user [156]</li>
<li>avoid adding too many features [261]</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules seem pretty well understood, even by non-UX people. The big ideas of DoET are gospel in 2018. Should you even bother reading the book?</p>
<p>I'd argue 'yes'. Given how often we make UX mistakes, and how little devlopers seem to care about <a href="../blog/dx.html">providing a good experience to other developers</a>, reading Norman is like reading reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People">Dale Carnegie's 'How to Win Friends and Influence People'</a>. The message isn't new but bears repeating, at least until we start getting it right.</p>
