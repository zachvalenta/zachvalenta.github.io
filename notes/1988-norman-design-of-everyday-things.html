<h2>1988 - Design of Everyday Things - Don Norman</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>overview</h3>
<p>This book is popular among the software developer crowds, analogous to a UX version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898">Lean Startup</a>.</p>
<p>The premise of this book is that many products are designed poorly <em>for the end-user</em>.</p>
<p>This bit, 'for the end-user', is important. A poorly designed product could also be:</p>
<ul>
<li>finely wrought</li>
<li>expensive</li>
<li>fashionable</li>
</ul>
<p>And so, a bad quality which should also be fairly obvious (the product sucks to use) can be masked, at least for people who don't have to use it sometimes.</p>
<p>Enter Don Norman. His antidote to this looks-nice-but-actually-sucks-to-use problem is 'human-centered design', which more or less amounts to 'do not make your product suck to use'. </p>
<h3>things I don't like about the book</h3>
<p>Design of Everyday Things is not well written and is unenjoyable to read. </p>
<p>The poor writing is not counterweighed with intellectual heft. DoET falls into the category of a <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/">Blinkist</a> book, that is, a book with 15 minutes of ideas spread across 200 pages of bad writing. If you buy it, buy it in an airport.</p>
<p>Another bother is that Norman invents his own vocabulary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call the signalling component of affordances 'signifiers' [page 13] </p>
<p>I call the combined information available to us the 'system image' [page 31]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>good ideas gone ubiquitous</h3>
<p>Norman offers some rules of thumb for designers:</p>
<ul>
<li>controls should be proximate to what they control [page 136]</li>
<li>give feedback to the user [page 156]</li>
<li>avoid adding too many features [page 261]</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules seem pretty well understood, even by non-UX people. The book's ideas have become gospel. Should you even bother reading the book?</p>
<p>I'd argue 'yes', if you're in the process of designing a user-facing product. Given how often we make UX mistakes, 200 pages of the same idea could be useful repetition. You shouldn't like it, but your users might thank you.</p>
