<h3>longer version</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I graduated university with a <strong>degree in English</strong>. My thesis advisor had a research focus in China and I became interested in the country, so <strong>after graduation I moved to China</strong> and spent a couple years learning the language.</p></li>
<li><p>After that I <strong>worked for Johns Hopkins University as an admin</strong> in a Chinese-speaking role for 3 years. During this time I paired up with a good friend and <strong>operated a media startup called Buy Buy China</strong>. We covered consumer-facing Chinese tech businesses and parlayed that into consulting.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2016 I attended a software bootcamp (Zipcode Wilmington) and started a <strong>software engineering role at JP Morgan</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>I worked <strong>at JP Morgan for 2+ years</strong> across two teams. I did mostly backend and ops, the former in PHP, Python, and Java and the latter re: load balancers, Cloud Foundry, and Splunk.</p></li>
<li><p>In spring 2019 I went on <strong>sabbatical in London</strong>, where I wrote a bunch of code and got into chess.</p></li>
<li><p>Since summer 2019 I've done backend work (Django/DRF, Flask) as a contractor for <strong>Capital One</strong> (risk rating) and <strong>BNY-Mellon</strong> (infrastructure automation).</p></li>
</ul>
