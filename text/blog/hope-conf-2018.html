<h1>NOTES ON <a href="https://hope.net/">HOPE CONF</a> 2018</h1>
<p><strong>hacking voting machines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the Federal government allocated a lot of money to reform voting system after Bush/Gore ('Help America Vote Act')</li>
<li>government gave out big-money contracts for military-industrial guys to manufacture new voting machines</li>
<li>the machines were poorly made</li>
<li>researchers are now able to buy old voting machines on eBay (some w/ voter info on them!), hacker conferences like DefCon do open hacks</li>
<li>this approach to voting reform didn't work bc the Constitution leaves elections up to states (who set laws around voitng) and the states delegate to counties; America's 3000 counties are the ones that really <em>run</em> elections</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outline VPN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>uses Digital Ocean under the hood</li>
<li>built on ShadowSocks protocol, which doesn't have a handshake (‰∏çÊòéËßâÂéâ)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>break up AT&amp;T</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>money from gov for instrastructure just pocketed by telecoms</li>
<li>presenter really laughed at his own jokes, which made me trust and like him</li>
<li>presenter's take is that competition/capitalism will provide as much of a fix as net neutrality </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>hacking healthcare</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>host devices do not have accurate time üòÆ</li>
<li>welter of interop problems re: commercial software and regulations (shouldn't have to care about whether heart rate monitor is a Phillips or a GE but irl you do i.e. 3 diff heart rate monitors, 3 diff measures of heart rate, 3 diff data formats)</li>
<li>electronic healthcare records are really for billing, not enough data to build useful apps for patient care</li>
<li>stackholders: patient, patient's family, doctor, hospital, researchers, regulators, insurance co, device manufacturers, data aggregators (Google, Apple)</li>
<li>n devices go to device manufacturer's server in hospital data center i.e. there is no single system integrator (closest would be hospital IT but they have little leverage on other players)</li>
</ul>
